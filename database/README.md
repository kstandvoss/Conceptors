## Databases
This folder contains different databases and sources for songdata. Mostly those are .wav files
and their corresponding textgrid information. Since those are quite big only a
few examples are actually stored in the repository, but there is information on how
to get all the files.

### birddb
This is the biggest collection of songdata and single syllables we found so far.

### robindb
This is data containing only one species (recorded in the Rocky Mountains) with annotated
syllables.

## Textgrid programs
There are quite some programs around for analyzing textgrid data. The one recommended in the robindb
sources is praat which looks roughly like this:

But there are a lot of alternatives (like [TextGridLab] (https://textgrid.de/en_US/download))
