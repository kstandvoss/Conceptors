RMBL-Robin database 
A 78 minutes Robin song database collected by using a close-field song meter (www.wildlifeacoustics.com) at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory near Crested Butte, Colorado in the summer of 2009 [3]. The recorded Robin songs are naturally corrupted by different kinds of background noises, such as wind, water and other vocal bird species. Non-target songs may overlap with target songs. Each song usually consists of 2-10 syllables. The timing boundaries and noise conditions of the syllables and songs, and human inferred syllable patterns are annotated.
  The database is used for bird song detection. It can be downloaded from here.
